# Flask-mysql-test

This is just a personal project where I'm playing around with Flask with the MySQL connector.

#### Install:

To run this project on your locally, first clone the repo and enter the folder in your terminal. Now setup a VENV with the command:

```
python -m venv venv
```

After that has been created activate the virtual environment by typing in your terminal:

```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Now to install the project dependencies type:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once that has finished installing everything, we can start the server with:

```
flask --app app run
```
